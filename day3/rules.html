                <h1>The Rules of Blackjack</h1>
                <p>Blackjack is a popular card game where the goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21. Here are the key rules:

                <h2>How to Play Blackjack</h2>
            
                <h3>1. Card Values</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
                    <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.</li>
                    <li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the player.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>2. Gameplay</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each player starts with two cards, as does the dealer (one of the dealer's cards is face-up).</li>
                    <li>Players can choose to:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hit</strong> – Draw another card.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stand</strong> – Keep their current hand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Double Down</strong> – Double the bet, take one more card, and stand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Split</strong> – If the first two cards are a pair, split them into two hands with an extra bet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surrender</strong> – In some versions, forfeit half the bet and quit.</li>
                </ul>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>3. Winning the Game</h3>
                <ul>
                     <li>A hand totaling <strong>21</strong> with the first two cards (Ace + 10-value card) is a <strong>Blackjack</strong> and typically pays 3:2.</li>
                    <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21, they <strong>bust</strong> and lose.</li>
                    <li>After all players finish, the dealer reveals their hidden card and must hit until they reach <strong>at least 17</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The player wins if their total is higher than the dealer’s or if the dealer busts.</li>
                    <li>If both have the same total, it's a <strong>push</strong> (tie), and the bet is returned.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <h1>Warning</h1>
            <h3>Busting:</h3>
            <p><strong>Be careful!</strong> If you exceed 21, you "bust" and automatically lose the round.</p>
